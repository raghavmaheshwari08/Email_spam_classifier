# Email_spam_classifier
In this project, I have tried making a mini project based on Machine Learning which classifies emails as spam. My model has been trained from the patterns of a false email and this training will let it do its job.
Workflow:
1- Loading the dataset and encoding it using latin-1
2 Data preparation and preprocessing( Checking for null values, duplicates and lowercasing, special character removal)
3- Applying CountVectorizer
4- Train_Test_Split
5- Using Naive Bayes Model
6- Testing the accuracy of the model

Outcome- Accuracy of 98 percent achieved
